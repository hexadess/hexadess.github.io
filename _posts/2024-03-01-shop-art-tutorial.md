# General

I was gone last weekend and wasn't able to add a weekly update. A lot of progress has been made since the last update that I'm excited about!

# Shop

I've introduced a shop room to the game. Most of the "behind the scenes" work I mentioned in the previous post went into making this a possibility. Now selecting the shops from the map will send you to one
and you are able to purchase items. Some refinement is still needed here for choosing what items are available in a given shop room, but it's functional.

</div>

# Tutorial

I've also started worked on adding a tutorial to the game. All the tutorial rooms have been created, but I still need to integrate a way to start the tutorial from the game.

# Art

I've got new marketing artwork for Rhythm Station! Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2691510?utm_source=website" target="_blank">store</a> and <a href="/rhythm-station">site</a>
pages to see the new artwork.
