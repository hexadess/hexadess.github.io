# Demo

We are getting ready to release a demo of the game for people to try. If everything goes well, the demo should be available next week.
With that in mind, this past week has largely been testing and making small tweaks and fixes to the game. You can check out how it currently looks on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2691510/Rhythm_Station/">Steam</a>. 

# Items

We added a couple new items at the start of the week.

  <img alt="Image of new room" src="/assets/images/blogs/demo-prep/arm-band.png" style="padding: 6px; max-width: 620px; min-width: 300px;"/>
