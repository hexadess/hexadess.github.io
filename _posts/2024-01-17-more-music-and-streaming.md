# Music

This past week I finished the song Red Moon Rising, which I previewed in the last post. You can take a listen here:

I streamed a lot of the development of this song which can be viewed on the studio's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HexadessGames" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a>. 

# SFX

Up until this point, all guns have been using the same sound effect for firing. I've found several new sound effects for different guns online and started the process of updating each gun to sound unique.

# Streaming

As I mentioned above, I streamed lots of the music development for my latest track. I found this to be a good experience overall. After I finished the song, I tried to stream some coding and it did not go as well.
I found it hard to concentrate on solving the problems I needed to solve while also trying to keep talking and explain everything I was doing. It was also the first time I turned on my webcam while streaming so I was
also having to put some effort into posture, trying not to slouch out of the webcam view, etc. Not only was I not able to properly work while doing this stream, but I just think it's not great content for viewers.
It's hard to follow someone coding, even if you have context of what they're doing. I imagine anyone watching would have just been lost as I jumped around code files and made edits to a big existing project they know
nothing about (though I did try to explain as I jumped around). I was thinking about it and as a developer, I really don't think I'd watch someone streaming coding. I think what I'd be more interested in is watching
someone make a planned feature or something, which I think works better for an edited video format.

The artistic side of things seems much easier to stream. It's not a huge cognitive load doing those tasks and I can more easily talk about what I'm doing or anything else while working. Going forward, I'll probably try
to just selectively stream things I think would be a good fit.
