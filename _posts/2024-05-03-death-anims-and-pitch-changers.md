# Animations

I wanted killing enemies to be more fun so I decided to add some death animation. Currently I've added 2 so far. They are definitely not final, but I do find it more fun to kill these enemies like this.

I am testing out adding AOE items that provide challenge by changing the song pitch on the fly. My current idea is that there could be spotlights that shine theses areas around levels.
