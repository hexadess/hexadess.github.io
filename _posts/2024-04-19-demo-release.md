# Demo

This week our demo was released on Steam! You can check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2691510/Rhythm_Station/">here</a>. We will likely periodically update it with new gameplay.

# Background Re-work

I decided to take some time and improve the space background. While it doesn't affect gameplay, it does look a lot better than before.

<div align="center" class="d-flex justify-content-around flex-wrap">
  <img alt="Image of old space background" src="/assets/images/blogs/demo-release/OldBackgroundSmall.gif" style="padding: 6px; max-width: 600px; min-width: 300px;"/>
  <img alt="Image of new space background" src="/assets/images/blogs/demo-release/NewBackgroundSmall.gif" style="padding: 6px; max-width: 600px; min-width: 300px;"/>
</div>
