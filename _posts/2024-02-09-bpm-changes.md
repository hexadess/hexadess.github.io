# Boss Update

I've been continuing from last week where I got some initial boss states added. The main work here was around smoothing out some of the moves and making it a more fair fight for the player. The boss now has to be much closer to the player to
attack them, and it telegraphs it's moves so you can react. A few polish additions were added as well such as the claw getting pulled back after the boss throws it out rather than it just teleporting back. There's still a lot more to do in
this department though.

# Variable BPM

I wanted to do something more challenging for boss fights than just a standard 4/4 time signature at a constant BPM. I'd been occassionaly working on a boss track here and there that changed BPM during the song. I thought this would be a great
challenge for the player. It wasn't too bad to modify the beat tracking code I had made to accomodate this. The end result is really fun. Here's a clip:
