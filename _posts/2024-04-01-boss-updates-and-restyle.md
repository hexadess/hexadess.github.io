# Boss Updates

Previously there were only sound effects for the chase + claw attack for the first boss in the game. This past week I've added various sound effects to the boss as well as updating the visuals.
You can take a peak in the video below.

# Restyle

I was watching some cartoons and noticed that often the backgrounds were not outlined with black to emphasize them less. They also often used textured lines that were not quite as solid. I decided to give this a
try in the game and really like the results. Here's the old room versus the new one. In the boss changes above you can see how everything pops against the background.

<div align="center" class="d-flex justify-content-around flex-wrap">
  <img alt="Image of old room" src="/assets/images/blogs/boss-updates-and-restyle/room-old.png" style="padding: 6px; max-width: 500px; min-width: 300px;"/>
  <img alt="Image of new room" src="/assets/images/blogs/boss-updates-and-restyle/room-new.png" style="padding: 6px; max-width: 500px; min-width: 300px;"/>
</div>
