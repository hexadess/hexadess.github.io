# Gun Sight

There's a new item in the game that increases your range

<div align="center" class="d-flex justify-content-around flex-wrap">
  <img alt="Image gun sight item" src="/assets\images\blogs\gun-sight-and-boss-animations\gun-sight.png" style="padding: 6px; max-width: 800px; min-width: 300px;"/>
</div>

You can also see what your range modification currently is.

# Boss Improvements

The boss now has arm animations for when it grapples / pulls itself around the level as well as sound effects. The arms were interesting to add as it was my first deeper dive into writing a shader. A couple other minor updates
are beating the boss now properly ends your current run and the boss changes colors on the beat of the music.
