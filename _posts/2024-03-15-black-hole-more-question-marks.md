# Room update

A while back I accidentally made the z-index of the floor sprite lower than the space background. I ended up thinking playing on the stars was kind of cool though so I edited the floor to have a window.

<div align="center" class="d-flex justify-content-around flex-wrap">
  <img alt="Image of room with full floor" src="/assets/images/blogs/black-hole-more-question-marks/room-floor.png" style="padding: 6px; max-width: 400px; min-width: 300px;"/>
  <img alt="Image of room with no floor" src="/assets/images/blogs/black-hole-more-question-marks/room-no-floor.png" style="padding: 6px; max-width: 400px; min-width: 300px;"/>
  <img alt="Image of room with floor window" src="/assets/images/blogs/black-hole-more-question-marks/room-floor-window.png" style="padding: 6x; max-width: 400px; min-width: 300px;"/>
</div>

# Black Hole Ability

I've added an ability where the player can spawn a black hole that pulls in enemies. I still need to do artwork for it, but the ability is usable.

<div align="center">
  <img alt="Gif of black hole ability" src="/assets/images/blogs/black-hole-more-question-marks/black-hole.gif" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; min-width: 300px;"/>
</div>


# Question Mark Events

I've added a few more question mark events to the game:
- Randomize ability upon use
- Increase your speed, bosses do more damage
- Cut your health, increase your attack
- Increase your damage, cut your range
